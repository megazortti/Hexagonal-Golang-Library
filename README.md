The purpose of this project is to use Hexagonal Architecture and Golang to build a REST library.

# How to run the project ( It's really easy to make it works. )
 - Setup json-server
   - Install it: npm i -g json-server
   - Make it run with the db.json on repository.
     - json-server db.json --port 3001
 - Run the GO project.
 - Go to ./cmd directory.
    - Run it: go run main.go


Have fun :D
